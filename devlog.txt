30 august
-rewrote marker code so it would snap to blocks correctly/ be reusable for other functions
-wrote a food object which allows for picking up and placing food
-TODO chopping meat, frying meat, combining food, picking up plates, renaming food objects to obj as i will use type for frying pan and plates etc

31 august
-refactored food to obj and reused it for pan
-food can't be placed on top of other food unless they are compatible and combine
-chopping meat and cheeze is possible with the implementation of nextid()
-frying meat is possible (but requires manual input) to produce burger_cooked
-combining food is now possible (you can now create an hamburger from bun and pan_meat_cooked, as well as hamburger_cheeze)
-When dropping food intro trash can it disappears
-Fixed disappearing frying pan using two if-statements as you want frying pan to remain stationary in hand or in obj_arr

TODO
-AFK frying
-One press on action key allows you to cut entire product instead of multiple
-Plates
-Order list
-Points
-2-players
-sprite compression using flipped tiles
-Washing dishes and dirty dishes
-throwing food

1 september
-Restructured draw_p_inventory() so that it is drawn differently based on player direction.
-One button press to cook and chop food using p-acting. Cook food is still not possible afk but doesn't require multiple keypresses. Solve by using action states?
-Added a timer and score
-Added double cheeze burger
-Added afk cooking
-Added music
-Added sfx although frying sfx is not working right now. Will need to implement a SFX manager
